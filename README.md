# Interax Resume

This is a Next.js project that leverages the power of Cohere AI and LangChain to provide a comprehensive review of a resume. The application uses Cohere's AI to extracts key information from the resume and to analyze the content, providing valuable suggestions for improvement.

## Getting Started

1. add your cohere api key to .env
```bash
COHERE_API_KEY=your-key
```

2. install dependencies
```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
```

3. run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
