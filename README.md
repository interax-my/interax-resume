# Interax Resume

Welcome to our Resume Revise application, a Next.js project that harnesses the capabilities of Cohere AI and LangChain to deliver a comprehensive review of resumes. This application aims to enhance the quality of resumes by leveraging advanced AI technologies for content analysis and improvement suggestions.

## Features

- **Cohere AI Integration:** The application seamlessly integrates Cohere's powerful AI to extract key information from resumes, ensuring a thorough understanding of the content.

- **Resume Analysis:** Utilizing Cohere's AI capabilities, our application provides in-depth analysis of resumes, offering valuable insights and recommendations for improvement.

- **Chatbot:** We've implemented a chatbot to assist you with any questions you may have about the application or resume-related queries. The chatbot is designed to provide information about the application's features, usage, and answer any inquiries you may have.
